# Mod_XML_files
these are the xml files from the mods which i use upon my own servers. 
everyone can use these as they wish but be warned they may need updating depending upon when the mods update and when i actually update them on the github. 
t.b.h, it's best to just use the files from the mods provided files when possible. that way the you know the contents are up to date!
i also added the new files which were added with the last 1.5 update for anyone who may wish to use them.
i hope they are of help...
